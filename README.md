Right now, I've introduced high dimensionality by one hot encoding a number of columns. There will be an issue of mismatch between the training and testing datasets. The solution would be to concatenate the two datasets and one hot encode the testing and training data accordingly so that I can properly one hot encode.

Spent the afternoon migrating the instance to a different source since it stopped working for some reason- it's working now.
